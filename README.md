## Connection Details:
•	Input signal → Capacitor (C) → Inverting terminal (Pin 2)
•	Feedback resistor (Rf) → Between Output (Pin 6) and Pin 2
•	Non-inverting terminal (Pin 3) → Ground
•	Pin 7 → +15V
•	Pin 4 → −15V
## Theory
A Differentiator circuit produces an output voltage proportional to the rate of change of input voltage.
## Working Principle:
•	When input changes rapidly → output amplitude increases
•	When input is constant → output is zero
•	Output is inverted
## Procedure
1.	Open Proteus software.
2.	Select μA741, capacitor, resistor, signal generator, and CRO.
3.	Connect circuit in differentiator configuration.
4.	Apply ±15V power supply.
5.	Set input sine wave (1V, 1kHz).
6.	Run simulation.
7.	Observe input and output waveforms on CRO.
## Tabulation
Sl. No	Input Voltage (Vin)	Time Interval	Output Voltage (Vout)
1	+5 V	0 – 0.5 ms	0 V → –2.5 V (decreasing ramp)
2	+5 V	0.5 – 1 ms	–2.5 V → –5 V
3	–5 V	1 – 1.5 ms	–5 V → –2.5 V (increasing ramp)
4	–5 V	1.5 – 2 ms	–2.5 V → 0 V
5	+5 V	Next cycle	Pattern repeats

•	Sine input → Cosine output (90° phase shift)
•	Square input → Positive & negative spikes
•	Triangular input → Square wave
## Result
The Differentiator circuit using μA741 Op-Amp was successfully designed and simulated in Proteus.
The output waveform is proportional to the rate of change of input voltage.
The circuit behaves as a differentiator.
## Conclusion
•	Output depends on frequency.
•	Output leads input by 90° (for sine input).
•	Higher frequency → Higher output amplitude.
•	Used in wave shaping and signal processing applications.
